				<h1>What is Microsoft Game Stack?</h1>
				<p>Microsoft Game Stack is the new umbrella over everything related to game development under Microsoft (Xbox, Azure, PlayFab, DirectX, etc.) and how we’re messaging ourselves to our customers as one brand and one place to go for game development solutions with Microsoft. We we able to tell developers how we can help them deliver a game from start to finish, not framing everything by product, but by the developer journey. If our customers are starting to build a game and say, how do I implement smart AI pathfinding? There’s the AI station and there’s a demo of our Havok AI. Rather than seeing Havok and wondering what solutions do they offer only to learn that’s not relevant to your needs.</p>

				<h1>The problem.</h1>
				<p>Last year, it was a totally different story. There was no unified story. You can see there’s separate brands, many voices, no unified developer story under Microsoft. PlayFab had it’s own booth. Azure had it’s own booth. Xbox has it’s own booth. As a company, we weren’t showing with solutions to problems, just separate products that we were trying to talk about.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h1>Our goal.</h1>
				<p>Ultimately, our goal was to help our customers find our tools and services. And we looked to do that on two fronts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Discoverability (Online + GDC): Frame our products through a lens that a developer understands.</li>
					<li>Brand messaging</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h1>Framing our products as solutions to our customers' problems.</h1>
				<p>Starting out that process involved meeting our customers. We ran a sticky note session and asked what are the questions they ask/the solutions they’re looking for throughout the development process. We wanted to know what our customers would be asking when they arrived at our site and our booth.</p>

				<h1>Brand: Bring Game Development under One Roof</h1>
				<p>Along side how we framed our products, on the second front was brand--bringing everything “Microsoft” and ”Game Development” under one roof to tell this wholistic story.</p>

				<h1>Role</h1>
				<p>Working on a small team with a short time frame of delivery, I was able to take on many roles: UX designer, visual designer, and prototyper. My key contributions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Building the brand of MGS from the very beginning--including logo, illustrations, iconography, motif, color, and more.</li>
					<li>Defining our strategy for achieving our goals for the first phase for showing at the 2019 Game Developers Conference (GDC). </li>
					<li>Working with our partners from Azure, Xbox, PlayFab, and Microsoft Docs to ensure hangoffs to our largest partners and resources were not jarring from a user experience or visual standpoint.</li>
					<li>Communicating with vendors our vision and brand guidelines, making sure every aspect of our marketing material going out to GDC2019 was up to standard and according to our brand guidelines.</li>
					<li>Developing plugins for Sketch and Adobe XD to streamline design process.</li>
					<li>Provided live visual direction for social media as it went out during GDC.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Measure</h1>
				<p>With this first phase, we wanted rebrand and re-approach our customers and reframe the conversation around game developers. And now we want to get to know what they want from us moving forward. We have some ideas, but the reaction we get from people at GDC will drive the efforts of our team into phase two. Here are some of those reactions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Day 1 numbers indicate we engaged with over 2,000+ unique attendees, 633 attending sponsored sessions, and 200 quantitative surveys conducted.</li>
					<li>Consistent feedback from developers who felt we were not “selling” to them, but rather listening and supporting them.</li>
					<li>300 trained TechSperts (game dev experts) helped to facilitate real-time Q&A in the booth and online.</li>
					<li>Over 15,000 pageviews and 11,000 unique visitors to MGS website, driving about 3,000 visitors to our partners by the end of GDC.</li>
					<li>4,022 booth visitors from 1,468 different companies.</li>
					<li>Across all Microsoft GDC activations – booth, meeting rooms, lobby lounge and sponsored sessions, we presented as one Microsoft from a visual and narrative perspective to give attendees confidence that Microsoft was here for them, and that we were on the same page.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h1>What I learned and what could have gone better?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Have a kit of the tools and resources your partners will need to do their job in one place.</li>
					<li>Being stern and clear with your direction will save you a lot of time when working with partners.</li>
				</ul>
